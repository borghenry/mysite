The Economist mentions the findings from the recent working paper "Economic Inequality and Legislative Agendas in Europe" co-authored with Derek Epp (University of Texas) in the article [As inequality grows, so does the political influence of the rich](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/07/21/as-inequality-grows-so-does-the-political-influence-of-the-rich).
