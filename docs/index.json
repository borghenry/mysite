It explores this question by analysing the number of written parliamentary questions submitted to the Portuguese parliament on two issues – unemployment and crime – between 2009 and 2015, and asking if MPs are more inclined to table questions on speciﬁc issues when their districts suffer particularly from related problems. The article ﬁnds evidence that constituency-level problem pressure does matter for the signalling activities of MPs, although policy specialization remains the main driver of their issue emphasis. This ﬁnding contributes new knowledge to the ongoing debate on the factors accounting for the representative relationship between MPs and constituents, by drawing attention to the importance of district-level problem pressure as one of the drivers of issue sponsorship in parliament.","tags":["legislative behaviour","Portugal","issue attention","Parliamentary questions","geographic representation"],"title":"Parliamentary Questions as an Instrument for Geographic Representation: The Hard Case of Portugal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Derek A.

From 1948 to 1994 the Christian Democratic Party was uninterruptedly in office, often in coalition, while the Communist Party remained the major opposition party. After the collapse of these parties, a new system based on the alternation between a centre-right and a centre-left coalition emerged. To date the Italian Policy Agendas Project has released six datasets covering party manifestos, parliamentary questions, investiture speeches, laws, decrees, and budgetary data. Through their analysis, it is possible to assess the elements of stability and change that characterized Italian politics since the mid-eighties as well as some recent evolutions such as the mediatization and personalization of politics, the crisis of mainstream parties, and the advent of anti-establishment and populist parties as key actors of the system.","tags":null,"title":"The Italian Agendas Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ana Maria Belchior","Enrico Borghetto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"a29526e93c89f81953d30a500076e600","permalink":"/publication/baumgartner-portuguese-2019/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.386686Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baumgartner-portuguese-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This book summarizes recent advances in the work on agenda-setting in a comparative perspective.

Taking an agenda-setting approach, the article tests whether a mandate effect exists, if incumbents also uptake the priorities of their competitors, and whether and how the introduction of alternation in government impacts on these dynamics. The analysis relies on data sets of the Italian Agendas Project recording the issue content of party manifestos and laws and covering the period 1983–2012. The results of time series cross-sectional models lend support to the presence of a mandate effect in Italy, a mechanism which was strengthened after the introduction of alternation in government. Opposition priorities may have an impact on the legislative agenda, but mostly when considering the legislation initiated in Parliament. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of the impact of government alternation, an institutional feature underlying – with varying intensity – most democracies, on the functioning of democratic representation.","tags":["opposition","agenda-setting","issue attention","parliament","electoral mandate"],"title":"Changing the transmission belt: the programme-to-policy link in Italy between the First and Second Republic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marcello Carammia","Federico Russo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"dc02694147288c9fa6d03fcb2c563f1c","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-policy-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.080615Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-policy-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy agendas studies analyse the dynamics of attention to policy issues over time and across actors and institutions to obtain insights into the functioning of political systems. The articles in this special issue draw on this approach to investigate key aspects of the Italian political system, with a special emphasis on the period spanning from the political crisis of the early 1990s to the watershed elections of 2013. They analyse a broad range of institutional and policy venues, including public opinion, political parties, the executive, the Parliament, and the Constitutional Court. While single articles address different research questions and focus on different institutions, they all share a focus on the dynamics of issue attention over time. This introduction provides a summary overview of the theoretical and methodological tools employed in the volume, highlighting how the study of policy agendas can contribute to the understanding of political systems and their change over time. It then summarises the main findings of single articles which, taken together, shed new light on several classic questions that have been widely debated in the literature on the evolution of the Italian political system.","tags":["Italy","government","agenda-setting","political parties","parliament"],"title":"Policy agendas in Italy: introduction to the special issue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marco Lisi","Enrico Borghetto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"13e6e73bc1deefe5dcb8c427838c100a","permalink":"/publication/lisi-populism-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.202123Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lisi-populism-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Populist parties have been gaining ground in European political systems.

This article relies on content analysis of election manifestos to examine the use of populist claims by the main Portuguese parties before and after the crisis (1995–2015). Our findings reveal that populist rhetoric has been used mainly by left-wing radical parties as a wedge to disrupt a decade-old status quo. Moreover, we did not find a significant increase in the frequency of populist rhetorical elements after the crisis, either in mainstream or challenger parties. Overall, in the Portuguese case, ideology is the most important factor that explains the adoption of a populist discourse.","tags":["Portugal","content analysis","radical left","political parties","economic crisis","Populism"],"title":"Populism, Blame Shifting and the Crisis: Discourse Strategies in Portuguese Political Parties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marco Lisi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"03d1ee4f13fb7178fd7d4dda73ffdb0e","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-productivity-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.022626Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-productivity-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract.

It has given traditionally weak executives the opportunity to adopt significant reforms while bypassing the notorious fetters of the ordinary legislative process. While the literature has to date focused on the motivations to delegate, there is still a research gap on what the executive does with the delegated authority. Based on a newly collected data set covering all delegation provisions adopted from 1987 to 2013, this article analyses why, in a remarkable number of cases, the cabinet did not use the delegations. Results show that the existence of an agreement on the policy in question (as captured by the precision of delegating criteria), as well as the complexity and timing of the delegation have a significant impact on the likelihood a delegation is used.","tags":["Italy","law-making","discretion","executive","Legislative delegation"],"title":"Delegated decree authority in a parliamentary system: the exercise of legislative delegation in Italy (1987–2013)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"07c4b712ae0ccdb7a4d802600668b90b","permalink":"/publication/franco-anti-populismo-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.125565Z","relpermalink":"/publication/franco-anti-populismo-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Anti-Populismo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5a961d634a3348a5581eddbd67f0f41c","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-challenger-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.488972Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-challenger-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["opposition","parliament","italy","m5s","oral questions"],"title":"Challenger parties in Parliament: the case of the Italian Five Star Movement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Federico Russo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"9ad716605ba4ad06e00b159284ba07f2","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-agenda-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:11.903776Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-agenda-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Question time represents one of the most relevant institutional arenas where parties compete to get their favourite issues on the parliamentary agenda. Parties select which issue to address by weighing up two commitments simultaneously: fulfilling the party mandate received by their voters at election time and responding to the current priorities of voters. This article assesses the extent to which the recent sovereign debt crisis impacted the way parties balance these two imperatives of democratic representation. Through the issue coding of around 10,000 parliamentary oral questions tabled in Italy, Portugal and Spain between 2003 and 2014, the analysis shows that the worsening of economic conditions intensified the impact of citizens’ priorities. However, there is no clear evidence of a decline in the importance of the party mandate for either the majority or opposition parties.

Legislative processes are conceived of as sequences of stages a bill has to go through before its final adoption. The relative time spent in each of these stages varies considerably. This work aims to explore the determinants of variation in the observed trajectories of relative duration.

At least one of the reasons has to be the perception of its inefficiency. Comparatively, the Italian law-making process is slow and most policy-makers complain about the difficulties experienced in trying to speed up the process. In spite of the political relevance of the topic, the issue has not attracted much scientific attention. This study tries to cover that void, focusing explicitly on the temporal dimension of law-making and analysing the duration of more than 3,000 laws approved during the period of 1987?2008: 21 years of intense Italian political history. Our exploratory analysis finds that successful proposals spend most of their time in those stages preceding the discussion in parliament, waiting to find room on the agenda. Concentrating on ordinary laws, we realise that the factors that expedite a legislative process are its sponsorship, the procedure adopted, the policy sector, and the timing of introduction, whereas the level of consensus is not associated with the duration of the process.

This study tries to cover that void, focusing explicitly on the temporal dimension of law-making and analysing the duration of more than 3,000 laws approved during the period of 1987?2008: 21 years of intense Italian political history. Our exploratory analysis finds that successful proposals spend most of their time in those stages preceding the discussion in parliament, waiting to find room on the agenda. Concentrating on ordinary laws, we realise that the factors that expedite a legislative process are its sponsorship, the procedure adopted, the policy sector, and the timing of introduction, whereas the level of consensus is not associated with the duration of the process.","tags":null,"title":"A Long Way to Tipperary: Time in the Italian Legislative Process 1987–2008","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Luigi Curini","Marco Giuliani","Alessandro Pellegata","Francesco Zucchini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"d2548929f1a11faa261d2891e2c519db","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-italian-2012/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.640606Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-italian-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Italian Law-Making Archive: A new tool for the analysis of the Italian legislative process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marco Giuliani","Francesco Zucchini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"1e10a18b2f6d84774eb2065ddabb55a5","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-leading-2012/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:11.079639Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-leading-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Leading governments and unwilling legislators.

In this article, we redress this bias by investigating the formal role of subnational authorities in the implementation of EU regulatory policies, specifically in the transposition of directives. Subnational authorities play a secondary, but increasingly important, role in the application of these measures. Their impact is greater on environmental and social policies, as it is also on public contract legislation. More decentralized states display higher levels of subnational involvement but, in these states, regional participation in national policy-making and a high number of regional authorities decrease the likelihood of finding subnational measures of transposition. There is also more subnational involvement in states with territories that have both an elected government as well as special arrangements regulating their relations with the EU. Finally, subnational involvement tends to prolong the process of transposition.","tags":["Compliance","regions","federalism","implementation","transposition","directives"],"title":"The role of subnational authorities in the implementation of EU directives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marcello Carammia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"a5f49b3f98c1620373ed6f98b8c2c354","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-lanalisi-2010/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:10.972371Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-lanalisi-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"L’analisi comparata delle agende politiche: il Comparative Agendas Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marcello Carammia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"8c7dfda0b396d2975e0fc28ed69bee56","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-comparative-2010/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.651024Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-comparative-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The comparative analysis of policy agendas: the Comparative Agendas Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Enrico Borghetto","Marco Giuliani","Francesco Zucchini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"1af8e14fbe3ef85d3b4a56df819e9589","permalink":"/publication/borghetto-quanta-2009/","publishdate":"2020-04-28T15:41:12.277449Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borghetto-quanta-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quanta Bruxelles c'è a Roma?
